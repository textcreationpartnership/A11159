            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Therfore this vyce and this ſynne is deuyded in two partyes pryncy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally / that is to wyte in the ſynne of glotonye / whiche is in etynge and drynkynge / &amp; in the ſynne of the ſhrewde tongue / that is in foule and folyſſhe ſpekynge. and fyrſt we ſhall ſaye of the ſynne of glotonye / whiche is a vyce that moche pleaſeth the deuyll / and dyſpleaſeth to god. By this ſynne hath the deuyl grete power in man wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of we rede in the goſpell that god gaf lycence to deuyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les for to entre in to ſwyn / &amp; wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they were entred they drowned theym in the ſee.

Ryght ſo is
<pb facs="tcp:21301:48"/>
it of hym that the deuyll holdeth by his ſynne in his me<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>te the deuyll renneth to his gorge lyke as the wolfe doth to the ſhepe for to ſtra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gle hym / lyke as he dyde to Adam and Eue in paradyce terreſter. This is the fyſſher of hell whiche taketh the fyſſhes with the grynnes by the thro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te. This vyce dyſpleaſeth moche. For the gloton dothe to hym grete ſhame whan he maketh his god of a ſacke ful of donge. This is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> bely whiche he loueth more than god and douteth and ſerueth it. God commaundeth y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he ſhol<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>de faſte. The bely ſayth nay / thou ſhalt not / but y<hi rend="sup">u</hi> ſhalte ete longe and take it by layſer. ¶ Alſo god commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth to ryſe erly. His god his bely ſayth thou ſhalt not. I am ouer full me lyſt to ſlepe. The chyrche is none hare / ſhe wyll not fle away / and it is not yet open. It ſhal wel abyde and tary for me. And whan the gloton aryſeth he begynneth his matyns and his prayers &amp; ſayth. O <abbr>god</abbr> what ſhall we ete this day / ſhall we not fynde that is o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thynge worthe. After theſe matyns cometh the law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des and ſayth. A lorde how well dranke we yeſter euen the good wyne / and how good mete ete we. Thenne af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this be wepeth the gloton his ſynnes and ſayth. Alas ſayth he I wende well this nyght to haue dyed / the wy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne yeſter euen was ouer ſtronge / myn heed aketh. I ſhal not be eaſed tyll I haue dronken. This god of the wom<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>be of glotonye is ouer euyll. For fyrſt he becometh a ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerner goer / and frequenteth tauernes / after he playeth at the dyſe / and after he ſelleth his good away / after he becometh a rybaude / an holyer and letchour / and at the laſte he hangeth on the galowes. This is the ſalary and ſcotte that is ofte payde for the ſynne of glotonye. This ſynne is departed after ſaynt Gregory in to .v. brau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ches For there is ſynne in fyue maners in etynge &amp; drynky<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge

Ouer moche to ete is a foule thynge to a man y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> hath aege &amp; dyſcrecyon whan he may not abyde a due houre for to ete and drynke. By grete exceſſe of glotony it happeth ofte that a man that is hole and ſtronge of bo drynketh and eteth without cauſe reaſonable tofore ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me ordeyned / and that he cometh to the meet as dothe a dombe beeſt. And moche ſy<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne and maladyes bodely hap<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pen oft by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> cuſtomes / &amp; therof it cometh that this glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton ſayth that he may not faſte ne doo penaunce.

For theſe glotons and theſe lechoures amonge all other euylles that they do / done a ſynne that is proprely y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> craf<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>te of the deuyll / that is whan they lette and withdrawe all them that they may fro well doynge / and mocke and ſcorne all them that loue to do wel. ¶Theſe glotons ſay that they may not faſte / but they lyen falſely. For lytell loue of god cauſeth theym to ſay ſo. For yf they loued as moche the veray glory of heuen as they do the vayne glo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ry of the worlde. For lyke as they faſte for theyr worldy occupacyon and temporall goodes often vnto the nyght as well myght they faſte vnto noone for the loue of god yf that they loued hym.

And trouthe it is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> lyke as one ſynneth by etynge and drynkynge ouer erly Ryght ſo one ſynneth by ouer late ſouper. Theſe people that ſo moche loue to wake by nyght and waſt the tyme in ydlenes / and go late to bedde / and aryſe late ſynneth in many maners. Fyrſt in this that they waſte &amp; loſe the tyme and torne it / whan they make of the nyght y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> daye and of they daye the nyght. God curſeth ſuche people by the prophete. For men ought on y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> day to do good &amp; occu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pye hym in good and holy werkes.

But they that then lye in theyr beddes whan they ſholde be vp and ryſen muſt nedes ſlepe whan they ſholde praye to god and worſhyp hym / and here the ſeruyce of our lorde / and thus leſe all the ty<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>me / and the daye and the nyght.

Theſe that ſo done ben lyke vnto a gulfe that ſwaloweth all / in lyke wyſe as an abyſme. It is ouer grete wyſdome to kepe meſure in etynge and drynkynge.

equyte is none other thynge but vnyte / that is egalte / all egall / who hath this vertue is a trewe Iuge and wy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe.

For the ſynner ſpeketh to god whiche ſeeth all his herte. Thenne the confeſſour is but the ere of god &amp; that whiche he hereth / ne knoweth not as a man / but as god. And the ſynner ought to tell his ſynnes with gre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>te drede / &amp; ought to open his herte and poure it abrode y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it flowe ouer / lyke as one ſhedeth out a full pot of water whan the water is poured out there abydeth no coloure as dooth of mylke ne odoure / as of wyne ne ſauoure / ne no ſmell ne taſte as of hony / thus ſholde nothynge be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayned of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſynne / ſyth it hath be ſayd in confeſſyon.

of ſynne / that thynketh on the ſynnes that he hath done. And delyteth hym in the remembraunce of them &amp; pleſeth hym. ¶But he ought for to thynke vpon them in grete drede / y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he falle neuer no more in them.

The vi. condycyon is that one ought ofte to confeſſe hym for many reaſons: Fyrſt for to gete more gretter grace and more meryte ageynſt god / lyke as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> lynnen cloth whiche is ofte waſſhen / is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> more whyte.

The byrde withdraweth hym &amp; departeth gladly fro y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> place as his neſte is broken and deffeated / and fro thens that his eg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges ben taken awaye. Alſo for to lerne for to confeſſe hy<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wel. For y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> vſage maketh a mayſter / lyke as it appyereth in theſe craftes. Alſo by cauſe that one knoweth not yf he haue be well ſory and well repentaunce / therfore he ought to haue recours vnto his confeſſour / and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe hym of all thynges ſuffyſauntlye. Alſo for to hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble hym ſelf / for to gete y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> more grace and more meryte ageynſte god / wherfore one demau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded of a monke wher<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fore he confeſſed hym ſo ofte / and he anſwerd / by cauſe ſayd he y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> I haue alwaye fere y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> I be not well confeſſed.

Now haſt thou herde how one ought too confeſſe hym. Now oughteſt thou to knowe that fyue thynges ſpecyally empeſſhe and letteth veray co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>feſſyon. The fyrſt is ſhame y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> one dare not ſaye ne tell his ſynne for ſhame / &amp; this maketh the deuyl / that put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth ſhame tofore for to cloſe his mouthe lyke as a theef doth / whiche that caſteth vnto the hounde a lytel glewe by cauſe he ſholde not barke ne baye. For the lytel glewe is of ſuche nature that it maketh an hounde dombe &amp; to be ſtyl whan it is put in his throte / but the ſynnar ought to thynke that the ſhame that he hath to telle his ſynne is a grete parte of his penaunce &amp; of thamende. ¶Alſo the ſynnar ought gladly to ſuffre &amp; drynke a lytel ſhame for to eſcape y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> grete ſhame / y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> all ſynnars ſhal haue at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> daye of Iugement whan all the worlde ſhall ſee theyr ſynnes.

Alas this ſentence how well that it is ſhorte / certeynlye it ſhall be ouer anguyſſhous &amp; ouer harde whan Iheſu cryſt ſhal chaſe them out of his companye. Suche harde a depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tynge ought moche to be doubted. ¶The ſeuenth thyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge that ought moche to moeue a perſone to mercy / is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fruyt and the good y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> groweth of this tree / whiche appye<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>reth in many maners Fyrſt in that whiche mercy geteth pardon to ſynnars. Of whiche mercy hath the lettres of pardon and of Indulgence. For god ſayth in the goſpel Bleſſed be the mercyful / for they ſhal haue mercy. After in the ſame letter ſayth he / yf we pardone not that one y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> other / god ſhall not pardone vs. ¶ Alſo mercy is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> good marchauntes purs / whiche wynneth ouerall / &amp; neuer le<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſeth. For as ſayth ſaynt Poule / mercy auaylleth to all thynges. A precyous ſtone ſholde be moche worthe that ſholde be good for all thynges.

But vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>de well this worde / y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he ſayth of thy rycheſſes and of thy godes / and not the goodes of other / as dooth ſome that wyll doo almeſſes of y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> whiche they haue taken fro other by force / by rauyne / by vſure / or by other euyll cauſe / &amp; maketh oft of other mens leder large thonges. But of thyn owne propre good whiche y<hi rend="sup">u</hi> holdeſt truely honoure god. For that other thou arte bounden to yelde &amp; rendre agayne. Alſo he ſayth that thou gyue to the poore &amp; not to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ryche / &amp; god ſhall yelde to the an .C. double therfore lyke as he ſayth in the goſpell. Mercy is a ſede that fruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tefyeth better in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> lene londe than it dooth in fatte. How that mercy multyplyeth the goodes temporell we haue many fayre enſamples / of whiche I wyll remembre ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me here. ¶ It is ſayd of ſaynt Germayne of Ancerre / y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> whan he came frome Rome / as he went out of Melane he demau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded his deken yf he had ony money / he anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he had but thre pens.

And whan his moder came &amp; knewe what he had done / ſhe was as out of her wytte. Thenne the chylde prayed our lorde &amp; the garners were full of whete. ¶ Alſo there as a poore man as it is ſayd that had but one cowe / whiche harde ſaye of his curate in his ſermon that god ſayd in the goſpell / that a man ſholde haue an hondred folde dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for all that he ſholde gyue for goddes ſake.

Alſo of an other poore man bycauſe that he hadde herde that god wolde ſo gyue an hondred for one / he gaue his cowe vnto his curate whiche was ryche. The preeſt toke glad<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly this cowe &amp; ſent her to his paſture where as his other kyen were. And at the euyn the poore mannes cowe ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me agayne home &amp; brought an .C. kyen longynge to the preeſt with her / whan the poore man ſawe y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> / he thought that god had kepte his promyſſe accordynge to the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell.

Theſe enſamples to fore ſayd ſheweth well / that mercy is good marchaundy<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſe for it encreaſeth well the goodes temporall. Alſo mer<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cy empetreth and geteth of god the goodes ſpyrytuell &amp; perdurable.

men in what ſomeuer eſtate they be / they done the fyrſt werke of mercy ſpyrytuell / &amp; this is the fyrſte braunche of the ryght ſyde. The ſeconde braunche is to teche <abbr>and</abbr> enſygne them that a man hath to gouetne. As a prelate his ſubgettes whome he ought to fede w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> good doctryne and w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> good enſample.

O good lorde brenne me here / and hewe me all in pyeces / rather than thou dampne me perdurably. Alſo ſaynt Auſtyn ſayth that the tourmentes of ſaynt

Of ſaynt lawrence and of ſaynt Vyncent whiche were brente roſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ted and layde on gredyrons / &amp; of ſaynt Steuen which was ſtoned to deth. Al theſe tormentes ne ben but a bay<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ne to the regarde of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> paynes of purgatorye.

The oxe y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſhal be ſlayne ſhal be well kepte &amp; made fatte / but he y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſhall be kepte &amp; lyue / is put to the yocke for to labour y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> erthe. A grete ſy<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gne of loue ſheweth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> kynge &amp; grete honoure doth he to hym / to whome he ſendeth his cuppe to drynke of. The cuppe of our lorde of whiche he dranke ben y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> trybulacy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons thaduerſytees &amp; y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> myſchyeues of this worlde.

The thyrde thyn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ge is to thynke on y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> paſſyon of Iheſu cryſt / whiche ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fred deth for to redeme vs fro y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> paynes of helle / there is no thynge y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſoo moche allegeth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> paynes &amp; y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> trybulaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of this worlde / this is well ſygnefyed to vs in holy ſcrypture / there where as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> chyldren of Iſrahel came to a water / y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> was ſo bytter y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they myȝt not drynke. Then
<pb facs="tcp:21301:142"/>
ſhewed god to Moyſes a ſtaffe of tree / &amp; ſayd to hym y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he ſholde put it in to the water that was ſo bytter. And whan he had put it therin / it was all ſwete. The bytter water ben the trybulacyons of the worlde. The ſtaffe of the tree that made it ſwete / that is the croſſe on whiche the debonayre Iheſu cryſte was hanged on for vs. For who that remembreth well this ſorowe that he <abbr>ſuffred</abbr> on the croſſe. There is no payne ne aduerſyte / ne tribula<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cion temporall / but it it is ſwete and lyght to ſuffre. The fourth thynge is to thynke on the ſpyrytuall godes that the trybulacyons dooth to them that ſuffreth them pacy<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ently. For the trybulacyons proueth the knyght of <abbr>god</abbr>. A knyght knoweth not well his ſtrengthe / vnto the ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me that he hath ben in batayle &amp; in prees. Wherof ſaynt Poule ſayth / that the pacyence proueth a man / and an aungel of heuen ſayd to Thoby / by cauſe that thou were pleaſaunte to god. It behoueth that temptacyon ſhall proue the. ¶Alſo trybulacyon purgeth the ſoule as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re purgeth the golde in the forneys / and as the flayle y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> corne whan it beteth it. And as the hamer the yron / as ſayth ſaynt Gregory. Alſo trybulacyons ben the medy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cynes of the maladyes of ſynne. For lyke as ſayth the ho<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly ſcrypture. The greuous malady maketh a man ſobre whome ſy<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne hath made dronke oftymes. Wherof ſaynt Gregory ſayth. Lete it not be harde to the that y<hi rend="sup">u</hi> ſuffre dyſeaſe on thy body whan thou arte guaryſſhed of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lady of ſynne within forth. Alſo by trybulacyons is won y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> crowne of glory / whan one hath good pacyence. Wher of ſaynt Iames ſayth / blyſſed is that man that ſuffreth temptacions / that is aduerſyte &amp; trybulacyon / lyke as a good knyght y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſuffreth the ſtrokes / for whan he ſhall be well aſſayed &amp; proued / he ſhall haue the croune of glory.

Theſe .iiii. remembrau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces aforſayd comforte moche the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that ben in trybulacion. The .v. ſpyrytuell braunche of mercy is to pardone his maltalente &amp; euyl wyll to euery body. For lyke as ſaynt Gregory ſayth / who gyueth his pens or his almeſſe to the poore and pardoneth not his euyll wyll / his almeſſe is nothynge worth. For god recey<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ueth not the gyfte as longe as the felonnye is in the her<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>te / for god weyeth / preyſeth / and taketh the gyfte after his wyll. And therfore our lorde ſayth in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> goſpel. ¶Yf that we forgyue not eche other / our fader of heuen ſhall not forgyue vs our ſynnes. Thenne he that wyl not par<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>donne and forgyue ſayth ageynſt hym ſelf / as ofte as he ſayth the pater noſter / for he prayeth that god pardonne hym / lyke as he pardonneth his euyll wyll to other. It is ſayd of themperour theodoſe / that he helde it for a gre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>te ſhame / yf one dyd to hym vylonye or Iniurye that prayed hym to forgyue hym / and whan he was mooſt angry / then he forgaue mooſt ſonneſt. For he had lyuer drawe to hym people by debonayrte and by loue / thenne by drede. ¶ The .vi. braunche of this vertue is to haue in the herte pyte and compaſſyon of the ſynnars / and of them that be in trybulacyon or in pouerte / or in aduerſy<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>te. For that one membre ought to bere y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> maladye of that other wherof ſaynt Poule ſayth / who that is ſeke / and I am ſeke with hym. And ſaynt Gregory ſayth / that ſo moche is a man more parfayt / as he feleth more in hym ſelf y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſorowe of another. ¶ The .vii. braunche of myſyry corde is to praye for the ſynnar / and for his enemyes / and for all treſpaſſes. For ſoo commaundeth our lorde Iheſu Cryſte in the goſpell.

God ſetteth nothynge of none euyll gyfte. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſſe whiche is made of thefte / or of takynge awaye of o<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ther mennes good / of rauyne / or of vſure / or of other e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uyll goten good pleaſeth nothynge to god. Wherof y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ho<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly ſcrypture ſaythe. Thou ſhalte not make ſacrefyce ne oblacyon vnto god of heuen / of oxen / nor of ſhepe / ne of
<pb facs="tcp:21301:149"/>
thynge wherin is ony ſpotte of ſynne. For god hath gre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>te abhomynacio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of ſuche ſacrefyſe. The wyſe man ſayth that who that doth ſacrefyſe to god of the catayll or go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des of the poore man. He dooth lyke to hym that ſleeth the ſone tofore the eyen of his fader. And ſaynt Auſtyn ſayth what gyfte is that / whiche the one taketh gladly / and that other wepeth And therfore ought euery man take hede wherof he dooth his almeſſe. ¶Alſo he ought to take hede of whome he dooth it wherof the ſcrypture ſayth / Beware to whome thou ſhalte doo good / do well to the good. That is to hym that thou weneſt that he be good. And gyue noo thynge to the wycked for cauſe of theyr wyckedneſſe. Lyke as they do whiche gyue to ry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauldes &amp; to meneſtrellys for theyr wyckedneſſe / whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che is a grete ſynne as ſaye the ſayntes / but who that gy<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ueth to them not for euyll / but for pyte and compaſſyon for theyr pouerte / or of theyr wyues / or of theyr chyldre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> yf they haue ony / or of theyr faders or moders / or for ony other good cauſe or reaſon / as for to withdrawe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> fro ſynne he dooth well ¶ Thenne the almeſſe ought to be gyuen vnto the poore / &amp; more to theym that be veray poore of herte and of wyll whiche haue lefte for goddes ſake that whiche they had / moche more thanne to other that be not poore with theyr wyll / but ſomtyme of pure neceſſyte. And ſomme there be trewauntes and ſloufull for to doo ony good / and myght gete theyr lyuynge yf they wolde. ¶And ſomme there be that by fayntyſe ſhe we ſomme hurtes and be faytours of theym ſelf that de<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ceyue the worlde. To ſuche ought a man not to gyue his almeſſe / but it ought to be gyuen to the poore orpha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes / to ſhamefaſt people to to poore wydowes / to the dyſeaſed and lame / and vnto ſeke poore people where
<pb facs="tcp:21301:149"/>
as it is nede / and whan one may do it. And yf a man is bounden to gyue to ſtraungers / he is moche more boun<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>de without comparyſon to his fader &amp; moder more than to ony other. For nature enſygneth it / and god commau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>deth it. ¶It is redde of the ſtorkes / y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they nouryſſhe fa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>der &amp; moder whan they be olde and may not purchaſe theyr meet. Thenne nature techeth that one ought to do good to his fader &amp; moder / and therfore it is well ryght and reaſon that myſchefe fall to all them that do euyl to theyr faders as it oftyme happeth. Alſo a perſone ought to take hede how he ought to do almeſſe and the maner of gyuynge. For .iii. condycions ought to be had in gyuy<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ge almeſſe. The fyrſt is that a man ought to gyue glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and with good herte. For god hath more regarde to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> hert than to the handes. Wherof god in his ſacryfyce as ſaynt Gregory ſayth / be holdeth not onely the thynge y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is gyuen / but with what herte. Lyke as it appereth well in the goſpell of the poore woman that had nomore but two mytes whiche ſhe offred in the temple. And our lor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de ſayd / that ſhe had offred more than all the other whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che had offred grete thinges / for more pleaſeth ſomtyme to god a peny that a poore man gyueth gladly for god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des ſake / than yf a ryche man had gyuen an <abbr>hondred</abbr> marke in ſyluer with grutchynge. And therfore ſayth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> wyſe man in the ſcrypture. Make alwaye good chere he ſayth in all thy gyftes. And ſaynt Poule ſayth that god loueth moche the gyuer that is gladde and curteys. The<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>re ben ſome people ryght ryche / and be ſo rude &amp; velay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous to the poore / that whan they demaunde theym al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſſe they anſwere to theym ſo vylaynouſly and ſo chur<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lyſſhely / that they do call theym truauntes / and vaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundes / and ſay vnto them mo than an hondred repro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ches
<pb facs="tcp:21301:150"/>
and vylonnyes. Suche almeſſe pleſeth not god and therfore ſayth the wyſe man in holy ſcrypture. Enclyne and bowe thyn eere to the poore man without heuyneſſe and anſwer hym ſwetelye. ¶ The ſeconde thynge that apperteyneth to do almeſſe / is that it be done anone and haſtelye wherof Salamon ſayth ſaye y<hi rend="sup">u</hi> not to thy fren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de / goo and come ageyn to morne / and thenne I ſhall gyue to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> / whan thou mayſt gyue anone. And alſo god ſayth / withdrawe not longe thy gyfte fro the poore and fro theym that be nedy. That is to ſaye / make thou not hym abyde / whan thou mayſt gyue forthwith. This is ageynſte many ryche men whiche make poore men to crye after theym / that haue to doo with theym. And ſoo moche delaye them / that they muſt ofte praye &amp; requyre theym tofore that they wyll ony thynge doo. They ſelle ouer dere theyr bounte &amp; curtoſye / that they do to them for lyke as ſeneque ſayth / nothynge is ſo dere bought as that whiche is requyred and the prouerbe ſayth that it is ouer dere bought that is demau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded Thus ſholde eue<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ry man haſtely do for his ſoule / as longe as he is alyue and hole / wherof the wyſe man ſayth. Fayre ſone ſayth he do well to thy ſelf yf thou haue wherof / &amp; offre to god worthy offrynges as longe as thou lyueſt. For the deth ſhall not tarye but that ſhe cometh. ¶And in another place he ſayth do well to thy frende tofore thy deth / that is to thy ſoule / to whome thou oughteſt to do well tofore thy deth / as to thy true frende / that is to Iheſu Cryſte to whome thou oughteſt to do well / tofore thy deth in al<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>meſſe for the loue of hym to the poore people. For that whiche is done to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> poore people is done to Iheſu cryſt lyke as he ſayth in the goſpell. Thenne the almeſſe that is done in a mannes lyf and in his hele / is moche more
<pb facs="tcp:21301:150"/>
auaylable / than that whiche is done after his deth / lyke as the lanterne that is borne before a man conduyteth and ledeth hym better and more ſurely / than that whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che is borne byhynde his backe / and therfore admoneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth vs ſaynt Poule / that we do wel as longe as we ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue the tyme that god hath lente vs whan a ryche man or lorde is comynge vnto a cyte or toun / he ſendeth his meſſagers tofore &amp; his herbours for to take his lodgyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge / &amp; for to make redy prouyſyon ageynſt his comynge or ellys the lorde &amp; his people ſholde be euyll pourueyed The good herbegeour and meſſager that taketh the lod<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gynge and maketh all thynge redy to ryche men in the glorye perdurable ben the almeſſe &amp; other good dedes that they do in theyr lyues whiche ben repreſented by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> aungelles tofore god. The almeſſes that ben done after the deth / ben lyke as the ſlowe ſeruauntes that comen late to the lodgynge / ſoo that the lorde is ſomtyme euyll pourueyed &amp; euyll herberowed. The thyrde condycyon that ought to be in almeſſe / is that one ought gyue glad<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly &amp; largely / after that he may forbere at his eaſe / wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the wyſe man ſayth / gyue to god after that he hath gyuen to the. And Thobye ſayth alſo / after thy power be pyteous and mercyfull / yf thou haue moche gyue lar<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gely and gladly / and yf thou haue lytell departe of that lytell with a good wyll / and euery man ought to gyue after his eſtate / and after that god hath gyuen hym. It is redde of a kynge / of whome a poore man axed a peny &amp; he anſwerd / that ſo lytell a gyfte apperteyned not to hy<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> was a kynge / &amp; of alyſaunder it is redde y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he gaue a cyte to one of his ſeruau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. And the ſeruau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t thought the gyfte ouer grete and wolde haue refuſed it. ¶ Then aly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaunder ſayd to hym I haue no regarde what is conue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyent
<pb facs="tcp:21301:151"/>
to the for to take / but to me what I ought to gy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue. The fourth condycyon is that the almeſſe be doone in humylyte &amp; in deuocyon / to thende that there be noo vaynglorye therin / ne to the poore people to whome the almeſſe is gyuen / be not dyſpyſed / ne for almeſſe done w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> other mennes godes / ne to gyue for to ſynne / ne for to ha<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ue preſumpcyon therby to be ſaued. Some people there ben that whan they do almeſſe they wyll that euery bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy knowe it. But the ſcrypture ſayth that almeſſe ſholde be doone in the boſome of the poore. For as ſayeth ſaynt Gregory. It ne ſuffyſeth onely to a good man y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he ſe of whome he attendeth his rewarde / and therfore ſayeth our lorde in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> goſpell / whan thou ſhall gyue thyn almes ſayth he / lete not thy lyfte hande knowe what thy ryght hande dooth / ſo that thyn almeſſe be hydde / for to eſche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>we the loos and prayſynge of the worlde / and thy fader of heuen whiche ſeeth in hydde place ſhall rewarde and yelde it to the. That is to ſay whan thou ſhalte do thyn almeſſe / kepe the well that vaynglory whiche is vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtonden by the lyfte honde be not medled therwith / but do thyn almeſſe in true entencyon / that is vnderſtonden by the ryght hande. I ſay not but that one ought to doo good werkes ſometyme openly tofore the people for too gyue good enſaumple wherof god may be prayſed. For ryght ſo ſayth god in the goſpel / that we ſholde do good werkes tofore the people / bycauſe that god ſholde be glo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ryfyed and prayſed / &amp; not for the prayſinge of the people as dothe the Ypocrytes. A good ſeruaunt ought to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed to ſerue his lorde tofore y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> people / for to honoure hy<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Wherof god ſayth / who y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſhall haue ſhame of me to<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fore y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> people / ſhal haue ſhame tofore thau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gels / &amp; I ſhall haue ſhame to ſe hy<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. This is good ageynſt them y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> leue to
<pb facs="tcp:21301:151"/>
lye / by cauſe they wolde not be reputed ypocrytes. And therfore ſayth ſaynt Gregory / y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> who that doth his wer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kys openly y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the entencyon be ryght to god withinforth And y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> doo it to pleaſe god onelye. Alſo who y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> wyll do al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſſe he ought not to deſpyſe y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> poore to whome he doth almeſſe. Therfore ſayeth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> prophete / ne deſpyſe not thy fleſſhe. That y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> poor man whiche is ſemblable to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> / and of ſuche nature of fleſſhe &amp; blode as thou arte / &amp; of ſuche fylthe. There be ſome people y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> deſpyſe y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> poore &amp; deyne not to ſpeke to them / &amp; yf they ſpeke / they ſpeke rudely and proudely. Thus dyd not Iob y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſayd / that he neuer deſpyſed them y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> paſſed by / for ony thynge y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they dyd / but gaf to them clothynge and mete. Alſo there were ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly men as wel kynges &amp; other many grete lordes y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> were not aſhamed to ſerue the poore men / how wel y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſome the<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>re be y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> do almeſſe to the poore / but they haue theym in deſdayn &amp; in deſpyte / and yf they were veray humble / they ſholde loue better the companye of poore men that ben good / whiche ben poore for the loue of god / and may edefye them wel by enſaumple / &amp; by worde / than many of the ryche men that ben about them / where as is in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> but flaterye / couetyſe / &amp; vanyte / &amp; done them moche har<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>me by euyll counceyll / and lette theym for to doo many good dedes. Alſo there ben ſomme people that do almes ynough / but neuertheles they leue not to doo grete ſyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes / ſuche almeſſes ſhal not ſaue them. For yf they deye in that eſtate / theyr almeſſe ſhall neuer kepe theym fro dampnacyon. Then ſuche maner people ben lyke to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that make theyr hows on that one ſyde / and depeſſhe and throwe it downe on that other ſyde. And therfore ſcrypture ſayth / yf thou wylt pleſe to god / haue fyrſt py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te and mercy on thyn owne ſoule / for who that is euyll
<pb facs="tcp:21301:152"/>
and vntrue to hym ſelfe / ſhall neuer be good to an other And therfore ſayth ſaynt Auſtyn / who that wyl ordyna<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tely doo almeſſe / he ought tofore to loue more his ſoule than another or ony other thynge except god / none ſhol<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>de ſaye that he were pyteous ne mercyfull that had not pyte of his owne ſoule poore &amp; ſeke / how wel y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he had py<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>te on others. Alſo I ſay not y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he is pyteous ne mercyful y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> hath no pyte on his owne ſoule / whan he knoweth y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it is ſeke to the dethe by deedly ſy<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne. Now haue I ſhewed to the ynough of mercy / the degrees / y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> brau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ches / y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fruy<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>te &amp; the ſpyrytuell good that cometh therof in this worl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de and in that other. Of the fruyte of this tree ſayth Da<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uyd to vs in the pſaulter in this wyſe. Blyſſed is he y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tendeth to the nedy &amp; to the poore. That is to ſay y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byde not ſo longe tyll the poore demaunde hym / but y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he gyue without aſkynge. Ne he hath no herte to gyue y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> gy<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ueth not w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>out aſkynge / he dooth wel y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> gyueth to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> pore but he dooth moche better that gyueth w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>out demaundy<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ge. And therfore ſayth Dauyd y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> prophete / blyſſed is he y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> entendeth to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> poore / &amp; wherfore is he blyſſed / he ſayth after in the ſayd place / y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> god ſhall delyuer hym in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> euyl daye fro his ennemyes. That ſhall be at the daye of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me whiche ſhall be harde and euyll to them that ſhall be dampned bycauſe they haue not fulfylled the werkes of mercy. ¶Thenne ſhall the Iuge ſay to them at that day Goo ye curſed in to the fyre of hell with the deuylles to be dampned / whan I had honger and thyrſt ye gaue to me neyther meet ne drynke. I haue be ſeke and ye veſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted not me.

that daye and ſholde be put in the poſſeſſyon of he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen. Lyke as our lorde ſayth in the goſpell. For he ſhall ſaye vnto them that haue done and accomplyſſhed the werkes of mercy Come ye bleſſed of my fader. Receyue ye &amp; take ye the kyngdome of heuen whiche that I haue made redy for you ſyth the begynnynge of the worlde: For that whiche ye haue done to the poore / ye haue done to me. Grete honoure ſhall god doo to them / whan he ſhall thanke theym of the werkes of mercy / and ſhal gy<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ue to them the glorye perdurable. And therfore ſayth he in the goſpell. Bleſſed ben the mercyfull.

meueth his lyppes onely as he ſpacke / &amp; no thynge ſayth To ſuche people god maketh a deef ere / but the prayer that cometh fro the depnes of the herte / that hereth our lorde as he ſayth in the gpſpell.

Ryght ſo doth the prayer that cometh fro the herte brennynge in loue of god ſmelleth moche ſwetely tofore god / otherwyſe the prayer may not be enhaunced tofore god yf it come not fro the herte / lyke as a meſſager whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che bryngeth no letters / ne hath no knowleche / entreth not gladly tofore the kynge. Oryſon or prayer without deuocyon is as a meſſager without letters / who ſuche meſſage ſendeth to the courte / he doth euyl his erandes who thenne wyll praye god veryly / he ought to crye to god fro the depthe of his herte / as dyd Dauyd / whiche ſayd in the plaulter / lorde god here my voys. For I crye to the fro the depneſſe of my herte. The feruour of loue is the crye fro the depneſſe of the herte / this ſayth ſaynt Auſtyn. Suche a voys and ſuche a crye pleſeth moche to god / and not the noyſe of wordes polyſſhed / wherof. ſaynt Gregorye ſayth that veryly to praye to god / is in the teres and bewayllynges of conpunccyon of herte. This crye chaſeth awaye the theues / that ben y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> deuyll les whiche lye in awayte for to trouble &amp; robbe vs. And therfore ought we ofte to crye and praye vnto god that he wyll kepe &amp; deffende vs fro the theuys of helle. Thus ought we ſtrongely to crye vnto god ageynſt the fyre of
<pb facs="tcp:21301:161"/>
couetyſe / or of lecherye / that he gyue to vs the water of teres for to quenche ſuche fyre that it enflamme not our hertes. Alſo we ought to crye too god ageynſt the euyll thoughtes that come ofte to the herte / that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> herte and the ſoule peryſſhe not by conſentynge. Therfore cryed Dauyd to god &amp; ſayd. Lorde ſaue me / and kepe me fro the perylle of waters y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> / whiche ben now entred in to my herte / and y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> dyſcyples of our lorde whan they ſawe the tempeſt of the ſee vpon theym they cryed ſayenge lorde ſaue vs for we ben in grete perylle. And for theſe thre thynges that I haue here ſayd one ought ofte to crye to god that he ſaue vs fro theſe thre perylles / that is to we<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>te fro the theues of helle / and fro the fyre of couetyſe / &amp; fro the flodes of euyl thoughtes &amp; of temptacyon. Now oughteſt thou to knowe / that in all tymes / and in al pla<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ces may a perſone praye to god. But he ought ſpecyall and mooſt deuoutely ought he to praye in the chirche on the ſondayes and in feſtes whiche ben ſtablyſſhed for to praye to god to preyſe &amp; honour hym / and therfore then they ſeace and ought to ceaſe al perſones fro bodyly wer<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>kes and temporall / for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> better tentende to praye to god and honoure hym / and to ſpyrytuell werkys. God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded ſo ſtraytly to kepe the ſabotte daye in the olde lawe that he made a man to be ſtoned tofore the people by cauſe he had gadred a fewe ſtyckes on y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſabotte daye what ſhal god do thenne of them that do y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> grete ſynnes on the ſondayes and y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> feſtes / and waſte the tyme in va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyte and in folyes / and yet werſe done they on the ſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dayes / on y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> feſtes and on ſolempne dayes than they do on other dayes.

ſabot. So ben the pryncypall feeſtes whiche ben eſtablyſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſhed in holy chyrche for to ſerue god / and to honoure and thanke hym of his goodnes and bountees that he hathe done to vs / and dothe euery day / lyke as holy chyrche re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>membreth. In ſuche a feeſt as is cryſtmas / that is of his natyuyte / how he was borne of the vyrgyn Marye. At Eſter how he aroſe from dethe to lyfe. At the aſcencyon how he ſtyed vp in to heuen. At whytſontyde how he ſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t the holy gooſt vpon thappoſtles. After there ben eſtablyſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſhed to kepe the feeſtes of ſayntes for to prayſe and wor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſhyp god and his ſayntes / &amp; to remembre the holy myra<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cles that he dyde for to conferme our faythe. And therfo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>re we ought to kepe the feeſtes of ſayntes / &amp; to pray the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> deuoutly to ayde and ſocoure vs vnto our lorde / whiche hath ſo moche honoured theym in heuen in glory and in erthe / and therfore they ſynne greuouſly that kepe not theyr feeſtes. For they do ageynſt the commaundement of god and of holy chyrche. But here ſome may ſay to me Fayre ſyr a man may not all daye praye to god ne be at the monaſtery / ne in the chyrche / what harme is it yf I go play and dyſporte me / as longe as I playe I thynke none harme. To that I ſhall anſwere. All the tyme that thou employeſt in folyſſhe playes and in vanytees / and in werke the whiche is not ordeyned in ony maner vnto god thou leſeſt it. For thou oughteſt to knowe that al the tyme that thou thynkeſt not on god / thou oughteſt for to accompte for loſte / this ſayeth the ſcrypture. That is for to vnderſtande whan thou thynkeſt on vanyte / and in thynge that is not in ony maner ordeyned vnto god. And certaynly he leſeth a grete thynge that leſeth his ty<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>me. This ſayth Seneke / for he leſeth the goodes that he myght doin as moche as he ſoo loſeth in worldly playes
<pb facs="tcp:21301:162"/>
playes and in vanytees / and that is not without ſynne for to deſpende the tyme in euyll vſage. For god requy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth rekenynge at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> daye of Iugement / this ſayth ſaynt Ancelme / and therfore ought one alwaye well to emplo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ye his tyme as longe as he lyueth in this worlde. And the tyme is ſhorte as ſayth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſcrypture. Ne no man kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth how longe tyme he hath to lyue / ne no man kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth whan he ſhal deye / ne how he ſhal paſſe out of this worlde who then wyll kepe the holy dayes as he oweth he ought to kepe hym fro doynge that deſplayſeth god and his ſayntes / and well to employe his tyme in god / in prayenge hym / prayſynge / and gyuynge hym than<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes of his goodes / and to here y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſermons and put them in eure and to entende to other good werkys and nedes that ben accordynge to god. ¶Alſo whan a man is in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> chirche he ought to conteyne hym moche honeſtlye / and do reuerence to god and to his ſayntes deuoutelye. For y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> chirche is ordeyned for to pray god and his ſayntes / &amp; not for to Iangle ne for to lawghe / ne for to Iape / ne for to ſpeke ydle wordes ne for to talke too other of ſeculer thynges. For our Lorde ſayth. My hows is the hous of prayer. And therfore a man ought not to doo none other thynge therin / than it for whiche it was eſtablyſſhed / this ſayth ſaynt Auſtyn / he that ſhall come tofore y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> kyn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ge in his chambre for to empetre / and gete ony grace he ought well to kepe hym fro ſayenge of ony thynge that ſholde dyſpleſe the kynge. Moche more ought he to be ware that cometh in too the chirche whiche is the cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bre and y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> hous of god / what he ſayth and dooth tofore god and his aungelles / and that ſpecyally that ſholde dyſpleaſe hym. Thenne god wyll not that a man ſholde make of his hous a market ne an halle. For he hym ſelf

There ought a man to calle ageyn his herte to hym ſelf and put awaye all worldly werkys and all euyl though<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tes / and thynke on his creatour / &amp; on the bountees that god hath done to hym / and dooth euery daye / and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membre his ſynnes and his deffaultes / and to humble hym ſelf tofore god / and to requyre hym of pardon and grace to kepe hym from ſynne / &amp; to haue perſeueraunce in good werkes vnto the ende. ¶Alſo in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> chirche ought the grete lordes and the grete layes to forgete all theyr glory / theyr rycheſſe / theyr power / theyr dygnite / theyr hyeneſſe / and theyr puyſſaunce / and ought to thynke that they be tofore theyr Iuge / whiche ſhall ſtraytely examyne theym / and rekenne ſtraytely of the goodes that he hath done to theym / of the dygnytees and eſta<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tes that he hath ſette them in / and how they haue vſed theym and he ſhall rewarde theym after theyr deſerte. Therfore ought they moche to humble theym to god / &amp; not to gloryfye them of theyr hyeneſſe / ne of theyr fayre araye / ne of theyr ryche robes They may take example of kynge Dauyd / whiche forgate his dygnyte whan he prayed tofore god / and deſpyſed hym ſelf ſo moche that he ſayd to our lorde Iheſu Cryſte. I am ſayd he a lytyll worme and not a man.

Prayer is good whan it hath in hym ſelf faſtynge and almeſſe / without theſe two wyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges the prayer may not flee to god. For as ſayth ſaynt Ambroſe / good lyf maketh the prayer to flee to god. But ſynne letteth it and with draweth it ageyn / wherof thou oughteſt to wete that in two maners is prayer lette / ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke as ſayth ſaynt Yſodore.

And thappoſtle ſayth that he that lyfteth vp his pure handes to god in prayer lyfteth vp in pure &amp; clene conſcyence wi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>thout ſynne. For god enhau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceth not the prayer that co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth of a conſcyence full of ordure and of ſynne wherof he ſayth by the prophete whan ye ſhal multeplye your prayers.

And this maketh ſobre the loue of god whiche putteth hym with all the herte to the wyl of god wherof Saynt Auſtyn ſayth / that the vertue of attemperaunce and of ſobrenes is a loue whiche kepeth hym in entyerneſſe without corrupcyon / and withdra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth vs fro the loue of the worde / whiche troubleth the herte and putteth it to dyſeaſe / and taketh fro hy<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ryght knowlech of god and of hym ſelf / lyke as a perſone ſeeth not clerely in water troubled.
